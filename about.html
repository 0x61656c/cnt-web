<div id = "fade"><center><h3>The Problem</h3></center>
<center><div class = "col-sm-8"><p>
  Our company was founded based on the irrationality of modern active fund management. From 2011 to 2016 HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index generated a return of only 1.7%, compared to the 11% gains experienced by the S&P 500. Most active players in the space have alpha values that are between negative and neutral, implying that they fail to beat market performance. It is unreasonable to assume that all market participants can rely on positive returns, but shouldn’t professionals have better track records than random selection?
<br><br>
  Almost regardless of market conditions and alpha values, hedge fund managers continue to reap immense profits, largely attributable to the managexment fees charged to use these products. The standard base fee model for hedge funds is referred to as the “two and twenty”; a two percent compounding management fee on the total invested capital and a twenty percent fee on profitable investments made by the fund.

<div id = "fade"><center><h3>How We Can Help</h3></center>
<center><div class = "col-sm-8"><p>
  Our goal is to increase post fee investor profits. By decentralizing our investment operations using blockchain technology, we're able to cut our expense ratio and consequentially decrease our fees fivefold from the two and twenty model while simultaneously maximizing the potential for high returns by deriving our investment decisions from a pool of meritocratically ranked, highly skilled investors. Combined, these factors allow our customers to attain maximium returns at a minimmum cost.
<br><br>
  Our core team is composed of industry experts from the Pittsburgh, PA area. As a result of our location, we have immediate access to some of the greatest minds in computer science, engineering, and cyber-security in the world through The Carnegie Mellon Gates School of Computer Science, Institute for Software Research, and Software Engineering Institute. We also have direct connections to the Carnegie Mellon Alumni network of over 100,000 professionals across borders and industries, allowing us unparalleled opportunities globally.

  <center><div class = "col-sm-8">
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of this company is to put money back into the hands of investors. Active management in its current form is far more expensive than it needs to be. This is an unnecessary externality that can be effectively eliminated by implementing a decentralized system.
      <br><br>
      We are strong believers in the potential of blockchain technology to reshape society in a positive way. In cutting our operations costs through decentralization, we hope to set a precendent for blockchain's role in the gig economy.  A recent study by the Satis Group showed that 80% of initial coin offerings are scams. While clearly there is a need for regulation to prevent such offerings, we are confident that the benefits of practical use cases will far outweigh any potential costs.
