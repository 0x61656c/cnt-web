<div id = "fade"><center><h3>About Us</h3></center>
<center><div class = "col-sm-6"><p>
  Our company was founded based on the irrationality of current active management. Most active players in the space have neutral alpha values, implying that they, through active management, fail to beat market performance. It is, of course, unreasonable to assume that all market participants can count on positive returns, but shouldn’t these supposed professionals have, on average, better track records than random selection?
<br><br>
  As indicated by the fact that this industry hasn’t been driven out of business, the answer is apparently no. The people who end up paying for this are the middle class. Almost regardless of market conditions, hedge fund managers continue to reap profits from their funds incredibly high fees. The standard model for hedge funds at the moment is referred to as the “two and twenty”; a two percent compounding management fee on the total invested capital and a twenty percent fee on profitable investments made by the fund, but in some cases are as high as five percent management and forty-four percent performance fees. 
<br><br>
  For a quantitative flavor, it's worth noting that from 2011 to 2016 HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index generated a return of only 1.7%, compared to the 11% gains experienced by the S&P 500. The data on this matter are conclusive; investors are paying active funds too much for too little.

<div id = "fade"><center><h3>How We're Different</h3></center>
<center><div class = "col-sm-6"><p>
  By decentralizing our investment decision making process using blockchain technology, our goal is to increase post fee investor profits. By doing so, we're able to decrease our fees fivefold from the two and twenty model while simultaneously maximizing the potential for high returns by deriving our investment decisions from a pool of meritocratically ranked, highly skilled investors.

  Our core team is composed of experts of various fields in the Pittsburgh, PA area. As a result of our location, we have fast access to some of the greatest minds in computer science, engineering, business, and security in the world through The Carnegie Mellon Gates School of Computer Science and Tepper School of Business.

  <center><div class = "col-sm-6">
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of this company is to put money back into the hands of investors. Active management in its current form is far more expensive than it needs to be. This is an unnecessary externality that can effectively be dealt with by a decentralized system.
      <br>
      We are also strong believers in the potential of blockchain technology to reshape human society immensely. In cutting our operations costs through decentralization, we can set a precendent for blockchain's role in the gig economy. Our hope is that this can also help to legitimize blockchain's use as a practical tool. A recent study by the Satis Group showed that 80% of initial coin offerings are scams. While clearly there is a need for regulation to prevent such offerings, we are confident that the benefits of practical use cases will make this a small price to pay in the long run.
