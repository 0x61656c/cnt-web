<br><br>

I want to preface this document by thanking you for taking the time to read it. Cryptonet Technologies is the culmination of years of blockchain interaction, programming, and desire to improve the world. I began officially working on Cryptonet Technologies in its current state in November of 2017, and it has evolved drastically since even then. In reading this, you have been granted access to a significant development, one through which I hope we can collectively maximize the utility of as many people as possible. 

<br><br>
<div class = "section">1.0 Introduction.</div>
The current institutional investment system is broken. As it stands, Hedge Funds typically charge a 2% management fee on top of performance and transaction costs just to hold investor capital. Over the course of 10 years, assuming 5% annual growth, this equates to nearly 40% of the initial capital invested.

Cryptonet Technologies wants to put this money back into retirement accounts. By decentralizing our investment decision making process through the use of blockchain technology, we are able to reduce total investment fees by a factor of five, and optimize our returns by incentivizing high performers using cryptographic token rewards.

<br><br>

<div class = "section">2.0 Problems.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">2.1 Current Framework.</div> The market for institutional investment is irrational. Most active players in the space have neutral alpha values, implying that they, through active management, fail to beat market performance. It is, of course, unreasonable to assume that all market participants can count on positive returns, but shouldn’t these supposed professionals have, on average, better track records than random selection?

Apparently, as indicated by the fact that this industry hasn’t been driven out of business, the answer is no. Unfortunately, the people who end up paying for this are the middle class. Almost regardless of market conditions, hedge fund managers continue to reap profits from their funds incredibly high fees. The standard model for hedge funds at the moment is referred to as the “two and twenty”; a two percent compounding management fee on the total invested capital and a twenty percent fee on profitable investments made by the fund, but in some cases are as high as five percent management and forty-four percent performance fees. 

From 2011 to 2016 HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index generated a return of only 1.7%, compared to the 11% gains experienced by the S&P 500. The data on this matter are conclusive; investors are paying active funds too much for too little. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">2.2 Purpose.</div> The ultimate goal of an institutional investment vehicle should be to make money for its investors. A significant quantity of the money spent on actively managed funds is contributed by individuals who are using these funds as vehicles by which to achieve a healthy retirement. In corporate settings, employees are often given incentives to invest with partnered institutional investment firms. One of the primary reasons for doing so is a lack of applicable knowledge, and a desire to defer specialization to people they believe are more qualified. This is the case in most industries; I, for example, would prefer to pay a contractor than build my own home. Unfortunately, a lack of financial literacy allows institutions to easily take advantage of the uninitiated. “2 and 20” doesn’t sound significant to the average investor, but, as mentioned in section 1.2, over a ten year period assuming 5% growth, the 2% management fee compounds to a level equal to nearly 40% of the initial capital invested.

<br><br>

<div class = "section">3.0 Solutions.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">3.1 Decentralization.</div> At scale, the most expensive operating cost of most  investment funds (and most service companies in general) is labor. Typically, funds seek out the best talent possible to maximize returns, and because the demand for skilled labor is high, the market price for labor is driven upward. By decentralizing our investment decision making process using blockchain technology, Cryptonet Technologies is able to substantially decrease operating costs, and subsequently investment fees. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">3.2 Autonomy.</div> In earlier operating periods, before the network has fully scaled, the fund will utilize a more typical investment process, with direct employees being the ones allocating funds. In the long run, our system is poised to become a fully autonomous organization, making decisions based on thorough statistical processes and analysis. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">3.3 Meritocracy.</div> The Cryptonet Investment Vehicle is cold and unfeeling. High performers will be rewarded handsomely, and, perhaps more importantly, low performers will quickly lose the ability to impact the system. This also serves as a means of spam prevention; while theoretically an attack on the system is possible, the probability that a hacker group or organization could build and sustain the reputations of enough profiles with different investment baskets to negatively impact the system is negligible. More information on this contingency in the Security and Algorithms Documentation.

<br><br>

<div class = "section">4.0 Business Model.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">4.1 Value Proposition.</div> Our platform offers a series of specific improvements over our competition. The most important of these is savings; by using Cryponet Investment Network, investors will save a compounded annual rate of 2%. Over the course of 10 years, assuming an average 5% growth per annum, this equates to nearly 40% of the initial capital invested. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.2 Revenue Streams.</div> Cryptonet Technologies will have two primary revenue streams—token sales and performance fees. Cryptonet Technologies will make every responsible effort to avoid charging compounding annual fees. 

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class = "subsection">4.21 Token Sales.</div> Token sales will be an early source of funding for the development of the Cryptonet Investment Framework. Tokens are the backbone of our investment decision making process. For more information on token sales, refer to our Business Model.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class = "subsection">4.22 Performance Fees.</div> Assuming the performance of the network is proficient, Cryptonet Technologies will eventually begin charging a flat performance fee. This fee will be a pre-set percentage fee of the profits of the entire fund over the previous period.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.3 Customer Segments & Relationships.</div><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class = "subsection">4.31 Investors.</div> Investor capital is the most important long term source of income for Cryptonet Technologies, and thus Investors are the most important customer segment. In our first round of fundraising, we will target a large number of investors for a small amount of capital (e.g. 100 investors each investing 1000 USD) . Subsequently, these early investors, assuming high performance, are likely to be more willing to invest more in the long term.

After proving our ability to generate returns, a large source of capital will likely come from retirement accounts. While this is not immediately applicable, it is worth keeping in mind for further developments. 

Investor relationships are to be treated with care, as they are the most important of our company’s long-term relationships. Needs and wants should be considered and accounted for wherever possible, and strategy preference should be granted based on this group’s requests.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class = "subsection">4.32 Market Participants.</div> The decentralization of our investment decision making process is one of our primary differentiating factors. Market participants are the key to this strategy, as they are the individuals driving this process.

Participants should be well rewarded in the early phases of our company’s operations in order to incentivize participation rates, garner attention from skilled individuals and organizations, and build lasting relationships.

<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div class = "subsection">4.33 Token Speculators.</div> In creating cryptographic tokens, a natural unintended consequence is token speculators. These individuals are likely not interested in the utility of the tokens, but rather in the potential for a future increase in value.

While this ecosystem should be watched, we will not cater specifically to speculators. While our token’s health is important, true value comes from long term product quality, not short term pandering.  

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.4 Key Partnerships & Partner Relationships.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">4.41 Ethereum.</div> In our early stages, Cryptonet Technologies’ decentralization will be facilitated by smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (abbreviated EVM). This provides a cost effective method of installation, and alleviates the need to launch with an extensively large network (as work on the blockchain will be completed by Ethereum miners rather than our own).

Relationships with Ethereum are not particularly important, given that the EVM is essentially a decentralized network.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.42 Legal Advisors.</div> Navigating regulations in the world of crypto is difficult on its own. Navigating Investment services regulations adds another layer of convolution. To assist in this regard, Cryptonet Technologies is taking advantage of the legal services offered by Project Olympus at Carnegie Mellon University. In doing so, we will have formed a lasting relationship with professionals in the relevant fields. 
We will follow all applicable regulations to the fullest extent possible. In the process of leaving room for error by sticking to safe decisions, we hope to make regulatory processes as swift as possible.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.5 Key Activities.</div><br> 
<div class = "subsection">4.51 Facilitating Cycles.</div> Planning market competitions will be required from the start of our firm’s operations. Variables to consider include length, breadth of choices (of individual investments), market selection, prize distribution, rating attribution. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.52 Investment Decision Making.</div> After proof of concept, the process of making investment decisions as a fund will begin. This process will be resource and time intensive, but far less so than traditional funds given that our market competitions will serve as a mechanism by which to outsource much of this process.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.53 Internal Accounting and Finance.</div> For regulatory compliance, accounting measures must be taken comprehensively and continuously, both in regards to the investment fund and market competition divisions. That being said, the most arduous parts of this process can be deferred until the commencement of the firm’s operation as an investment fund (allowing for a fast, adaptable proof of concept).

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.54 Product Development.</div> Product development is a process that started on day one and will continue indefinitely. Differentiation is achieved through innovation--our future success is directly dependent on how much we invest into it. Blockchain technology in particular is fledgling field with immense capacity for growth in the next few years. By being at the forefront of the decentralization movement, we can ensure an advantageous position in the coming years. 

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.6 Key Resources (Excluding Cash).</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">4.61 Ethereum.</div> Each improvement on to our software relevant to on-chain processing will require ethereum to propagate. This fee will be dependent on the size of the change, but in the event of a choice between cost and security, we will always choose to sacrifice the former over the latter, within reason.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.62 Time.</div> The output of any company is not statically proportional to its inputs. That being said, in early operations, significantly more hours will be required per employee than later, in an effort to develop the optimal platform and fund structure. That being said, we expect internal contributors to apply themselves to the fullest reasonable extent, in the interest of creating a lasting organization that can positively impact society in the most significant ways possible.

<br><br>


<div class = "subsection">4.63 Assets Under Management.</div> For funds, assets under management (abbreviated AUM) are typically the most important operational factor because they drive revenue. Of course, this will be an important element of our operations as well. For hedge funds, the primary advantage provided by a high AUM is the ability to further increase market share through leverage. While we don’t anticipate the use of leverage in our positions in the short term, our AUM will be an important factor in deciding when to expand to new markets.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">4.7 Distribution Channels.<br></div>

<div class = "subsection">4.71 Short Term.</div> Customer interaction in the short term will be direct. This will be in an effort to perform adequate testing and screening. By taking this route, we can minimize our potential for experiencing litigation.

<br><br>


<div class = "subsection">4.72 Long Term.</div> In the long term, we are confident that we will be able to completely automate this process, while maintaining the same level of integrity. One of the biggest problems with scaling horizontally in this manner is verifying that users are accredited investors, although even this problem can be solved in a variety of ways.

<br><br>

<div class = "section">5.0 Platform Specific Developments.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">5.1 Blockchain Technology.</div> Our decentralized protocols are optimized to function on a blockchain based system. Blockchain technology is an incredibly useful asset in fields that require security, autonomy, and decentralization. As established in section 3, our platform benefits from each of these qualities immensely.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">5.2 Implementation.</div> To decrease operating costs, our platform will at least begin its life operating on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (abbreviated EVM). We have chosen the EVM as our platform of choice over other similar services because it provides the largest, most developed decentralized application network. This size also makes the EVM the most probabilistically secure choice, and upcoming Ethereum Improvement Protocols are likely to improve upon this further.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">5.3 Reputation Algorithms & Neural Characteristics.</div> Our participant organization can be viewed a neural network in which each individual represents a node. Similarly to a neural network, our platform will continue to learn and grow over time (with more valid data input), improving speed and returns. 

<br><br>

<div class = "section">6.0 Potential Risks & Mitigation.</div><br>
<div class = "subsection">6.1 Initial Performance.</div> Our platform is, as described in 4.3, designed in a way that allows it to learn over time. As a result of this, early cycles are likely to have lower returns than subsequent ones. Luckily, this problem is easily addressable; In our first few cycles of operation, the company will operate without any money at stake to optimize and ensure the efficacy of the network. Participants will still earn rewards for participating in the form of our ERC-20 token, but this data will be purely for analysis and won’t be used for informing investment decisions.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">6.2 Strategic Fee Schedule Adjustment.</div> Our initial strategic decision making will be limited to long term stock holdings for easy of programmability. In this space fees are negligible, but as we expand into more markets it is likely our fee schedule and strategy will need to be tweaked to account for this. Our goal is to eliminate hidden fees entirely (enabling us to provide a transparent, accessible platform) and a necessary alternative may be to increase network fees by a few pips, although we will try to avoid this outcome at all costs.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">6.3 Incentivization.</div> In order to decentralize the investment decision making process, we need to create incentives that drive high performers towards our platform. Our model does not depend on individuals taking any particular action; given that rewards will be heavily skewed towards high performers, it seems natural that our system can reward effort adequately, in tandem with skill.

<br><br>

<div class = "subsection">6.4 Litigation.</div> We intend on developing Cryptonet Technologies in a way that minimizes the risk of litigation. There are currently too many fraudulent initial coin offerings in the Cryptosphere. As we’ve seen in countless cases (Ripple, ETH, etc.) as soon as the appropriate regulatory bodies are finished catching up, even the largest organizations will be in danger if they didn’t follow appropriate risk mitigation procedures. Cryptonet Technologies will abide by all regulatory requirements of typical investment funds and provide complete transparency in its operations.

<br><br> 

<div class = "section">7.0 Conclusions.</div> Using this model as a general operational outline, we are confident that Cryptonet Technologies is capable of creating the world’s first decentralized investment vehicle. In using blockchain technology to decentralize our decision making process, we can decrease our operational costs substantially, increasing investor returns in a directly proportional manner.
